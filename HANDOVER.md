# WP-Migrate Handover

## ✅ Completed Work & Outcomes

**Plugin Status**: Production-ready WordPress migration tool with HMAC authentication fully operational. Core functionality includes secure REST API endpoints, 64MB chunked file uploads, MySQL export/import, and resumable state machine.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Secure REST API (6 endpoints) with HMAC-SHA256 authentication working across all endpoints
- Complete migration workflow: handshake → files → database → finalize
- 9-state job management with strict transition validation
- Automated production and staging deployment pipelines
- Comprehensive test suite with security, integration, and unit tests
- Migration dry-run testing script for validation

**Recent Achievements**:
- Fixed critical HMAC authentication header normalization issues (Cloudflare proxy compatibility)
- Resolved path normalization for query parameters in HMAC signature calculation
- Cleaned up deployment scripts with correct variable naming and zip file handling
- All API endpoints now properly secured and functional

## ❌ Failures & Open Issues

**Resolved Issues**:
- HMAC header normalization bug (hyphens vs underscores in HTTP headers)
- Path normalization missing query parameters in signature calculation
- Deployment script variable naming inconsistencies (STAGING_* vs PRODUCTION_*)
- ZIP file extraction structure issues (nested directory problems)
- API response format handling in test scripts

**Current Limitations**:
- Emergency procedures require command-line access (no admin UI)
- Rollback changes state only (no actual data restoration)
- No automatic error recovery mechanisms
- No real-time progress monitoring UI

**Known Edge Cases**:
- Large file uploads (>2GB) may require manual chunk size adjustment
- MySQL timeout issues on very large databases (1000+ tables)
- WordPress multisite not supported
- Staging handshake will fail until shared keys are configured on both sites

## 📝 Files Changed & Key Insights

**Recent Critical Changes**:
- `src/Security/HmacAuth.php`: Fixed header normalization and path query parameter handling
- `src/Rest/Api.php`: Updated `/jobs/active` endpoint to use proper authentication
- `tests/TestHelper.php`: Updated HMAC header generation to use underscores (not hyphens)
- `tests/Security/HmacAuthTest.php`: Fixed test cases for header tampering scenarios
- `deploy-to-production.sh`: Clean, simple production deployment script
- `deploy-to-staging.sh`: Comprehensive staging deployment with health checks
- `test-migration-dry-run.sh`: Full migration workflow testing script

**Key Insights**:
- **Authentication**: PHP $_SERVER normalizes HTTP headers (X-MIG-Timestamp → X_MIG_TIMESTAMP)
- **Path Normalization**: Must include query parameters in HMAC signature calculation
- **Deployment**: Extract ZIP files directly (don't create nested directories)
- **Testing**: Handle different API response formats (some endpoints return {"lines":[]} without "ok" field)

## ⚠️ Gotchas to Avoid

**Authentication Issues**:
- HTTP headers are normalized by PHP $_SERVER superglobal (hyphens become underscores)
- Always include query parameters in path for HMAC signature calculation
- Clock skew tolerance: 5 minutes max (300000ms)
- Nonce TTL: 1 hour to prevent replay attacks

**Deployment Issues**:
- ZIP files contain wp-migrate/ directory - extract directly, don't create nested structure
- Use correct variable names: PRODUCTION_* for production, STAGING_* for staging
- Always recreate deployment packages after code changes
- Verify plugin activation after deployment

**Testing Pitfalls**:
- Logs endpoint returns {"lines":[]} without "ok" field - handle this format
- Database export requires job_id parameter
- Staging handshake failure is expected until shared keys are configured

## 🚀 Current System Status

**Migration System**: Fully operational with all critical tests passing
- Production handshake: ✅ Working
- Job management: ✅ Working  
- Progress monitoring: ✅ Working
- Logging system: ✅ Working
- Database export: ✅ Ready (requires job_id)

**Deployment Status**:
- Production: Plugin deployed and active (version 1.0.35)
- Staging: Ready for configuration
- Scripts: All corrected and tested

**Next Development Priorities**:
