  - Updated `HmacAuth.php` constants to use underscores (`x_mig_timestamp`)
  - Fixed all API endpoints: handshake, monitor, jobs/active, etc.
  - All 204 tests now pass successfully

#### **Technical Details**
- **Header Constants Updated**: Changed from hyphens to underscores
  - `HDR_TS`: `x-mig-timestamp` ‚Üí `x_mig_timestamp`
  - `HDR_NONCE`: `x-mig-nonce` ‚Üí `x_mig_nonce`
  - `HDR_PEER`: `x-mig-peer` ‚Üí `x_mig_peer`
  - `HDR_SIG`: `x-mig-signature` ‚Üí `x_mig_signature`

- **Test Infrastructure Updated**: Fixed test headers to match new constants
  - Updated `TestHelper::generateValidHmacHeaders()` to use underscores
  - Fixed all HMAC authentication tests
  - Maintained test coverage and reliability

#### **Impact**
